### Context: 

**R.code**: R scripts used to reproduce all statistical results and visualized pictures.

**Source Data**: The original data analyzed using R are located in the Data and Source datas folder. 

Figure 1. The impact of influenza vaccination on the respiratory microbiota is greater than that on the gut

Figure 2. Longitudinal dynamics of gut and upper respiratory tract microbes induced by TIV vaccination

Figure 3. Gut microbiota particularly Segatella copri are associated with an enhanced antibody response to vaccinations

Figure 4. S. copri enhances TIV immunogenicity through its relation to PAGln levels

Figure 5. S. copri enhances specific antibody levels by suppressing the production of PAGln by gut microbiota

Figure 6. PAGln weakens the specific antibody levels by affecting the function of germinal center B cells
