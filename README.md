### Supporting code for manuscript: 

 **‘Joint contribution of gut and respiratory microbial communities in the immune response to seasonal influenza vaccination’**

### Context: 

**Figure 1.**  Prevalence of gut *Prevotella copri* significantly correlated with TIV-specific antibody production.

**Figure 2.**  Multi-omics analysis revealed that gut *P. copri* and *A. megaguti*-associated L-lysine metabolism strengthened the TIV vaccination response.

**Figure 3.**  Influenza vaccination has a greater impact on the URT microbiota than the gut microbiota.

**Figure 4.**  URT microbes are enriched in the gut and interact with the gut microbiota.

**Figure 5.**  TIV vaccination is associated with an increase in Streptococcus and loss of some species in the URT. 

**Figure 6.**  TIV vaccination reshapes the URT microbiota, affecting functional gene expression. 

**Extended Data Figure 1.** Detection of H1N1-specific antibodies and correlation analysis between the antibody titer and host or microbial factors.

**Extended Data Figure 2.** Multi-omics analysis framework and inter-omics variable association analysis.

**Extended Data Figure 3.** PERMANOVA analysis between pre- vaccination and post-vaccination.

**Extended Data Figure 4.** Vaccination led to changes in microbial interaction network and species abundance of *Bifidobacterium*.

**Extended Data Figure 5.** Impact of vaccination on the abundance and microbial interaction network of dominant microbes in the upper respiratory tract.

**Extended Data Figure 6.** Vaccination affected the association between abundances of microbes and microbial gene function.
